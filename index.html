            <h1 class="Dana-header-3">Location and Land</h1>
            <p class="Dana-subtext-3">Lebanon is a country located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It consists of a narrow strip of territory that is bounded to the North and East by Syria, to the South by Palestine, and the West by the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
        </div>

            <h2 class="Dana-header-3">Climate</h2>
            <p class="Dana-subtext-3"> The climate of Lebanon is generally subtropical and is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, humid winters. Nearly all precipitation falls in winter, averaging 30 to 40 inches on the coast and rising to more than 50 inches in higher altitudes. On the higher mountaintops, this precipitation falls as heavy snow that remains until early summer. <br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="Dana-header-3"> Plants and Animals </h2> 
            <p class="Dana-subtext-3">Lebanon was heavily forested in ancient and medieval times, and its timber—particularly its famed cedar—was exported for building and shipbuilding. The natural vegetation, however, has been grazed, burned, and cut for so long that little of it is regenerated. What survives is a wild Mediterranean vegetation of brush and low trees, mostly oaks, pines, cypresses, firs, junipers, and carobs. <br> Few large wild animals survive in Lebanon, though bears are occasionally seen in the mountains. Among the smaller animals, deer, wildcats, hedgehogs, squirrels, martens, dormice, and hares are found. </p>

            <h1 class="Dana-header-3">History</h1>
            <p class="Dana-subtext-3"> The borders of contemporary Lebanon are a product of the Treaty of Sèvres of 1920. Its territory was in the core of the Bronze Age Canaanite (Phoenician) city-states. As part of the Levant, it was part of numerous succeeding empires throughout ancient history, including the Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Achaemenid Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Sasanid Persian empires. <br> After the 7th-century Muslim conquest of the Levant, it was part of the Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid Seljuk and Fatimid empires. The crusader state of the County of Tripoli, founded by Raymond IV of Toulouse in 1102, encompassed most of present-day Lebanon, falling to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289 and finally to the Ottoman Empire in 1516. With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Greater Lebanon fell under French mandate in 1920, and gained independence under president Bechara El Khoury in 1943. Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of relative political stability and prosperity based on Beirut's position as a regional center for finance and trade, interspersed with political turmoil and armed conflict (1948 Arab–Israeli War, Lebanese Civil War 1975–1990, 2005 Cedar Revolution, 2006 Lebanon War, 2007 Lebanon conflict, 2006–08 Lebanese protests, 2008 conflict in Lebanon, 2011 Syrian Civil War spillover, and 2019–20 Lebanese protests).</p>

            <h1 class="Dana-header-3">People</h1>
            <h2 class="Dana-header-3"> Language and Ethnicity </h2>
            <p class="Dana-subtext-3">Lebanon has a heterogeneous society composed of numerous ethnic, religious, and kinship groups. Ethnically, the Lebanese compose a mixture in which Phoenician, Greek, Armenian, and Arab elements are discernible. Within the larger Lebanese community, ethnic minorities including Armenian and Kurdish populations are also present. Arabic is the official language, although smaller proportions of the population are Armenian- or Kurdish-speaking; French and English are also spoken. <br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="Dana-header-3"> Religion </h2> 
            <p class="Dana-subtext-3"> Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Lebanon’s social structure is its varied religious composition. Lebanon is the most religiously diverse country in the Middle East. The two largest groups are the Shiʿi Muslims and the Sunni Muslims, each comprising more than one-fourth of the population. Maronites, a Roman Catholic Eastern rite group that originated in the region, make up more than one-fifth of the population. A number of other Christian communities are also present, including the Greek Orthodox and the Greek Catholics. The Druze constitute a small percentage of the population but play an influential role in Lebanese society.</p>

            <h1 class="Dana-header-3">Government and politics</h1>
            <p class="Dana-subtext-3"> Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy that includes confessionalism, in which high-ranking offices are reserved for members of specific religious groups. The President, for example, has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi’a Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox. This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and to represent fairly the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government.<br> Until 1975, Freedom House considered Lebanon to be among only two (together with Israel) politically free countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. The country lost this status with the outbreak of the Civil War, and has not regained it since. Lebanon was rated "Partly Free" in 2013. Even so, Freedom House still ranks Lebanon as among the most democratic nations in the Arab world. <br> The Parliament is elected for a four-year term by popular vote on the basis of sectarian proportional representation.<br>The executive branch consists of the President, the head of state, and the Prime Minister, the head of government. The parliament elects the president for a non-renewable six-year term by a two-thirds majority. The president appoints the Prime Minister, following consultations with the parliament. The president and the prime minister form a cabinet, which must also adhere to the sectarian distribution set out by confessionalism. </p>

            <p class="Dana-subtext-3"> According to surveys from the World Economic Forum's 2013 Global Information Technology Report, Lebanon has been ranked globally as the fourth best country for math and science education, and as the tenth best overall for quality of education. In quality of management schools, the country was ranked 13th worldwide. <br> All Lebanese schools are required to follow a prescribed curriculum designed by the Ministry of Education. Some of the 1400 private schools offer IB programs, and may also add more courses to their curriculum with approval from the Ministry of Education. The first eight years of education are, by law, compulsory. <br> Lebanon has forty-one nationally accredited universities, several of which are internationally recognized. The American University of Beirut (AUB) and the Saint Joseph University of Beirut (USJ) were the first Anglophone and the first Francophone universities to open in Lebanon, respectively. Universities in Lebanon, both public and private, largely operate in French or English. <br> The top-ranking universities in the country are the American University of Beirut (#242 worldwide, #2 in the Middle East as of 2022), University of Balamand (#511 worldwide, #17 in the region), Lebanese American University (#581 worldwide, #17 in the region) </p>
